This is a sample paragraph. It contains the pattern %x%. This example includes several occurrences of a simple pattern for demonstration purposes. Let's use %x% as the pattern to be matched. In this sample paragraph, we will include the pattern %x% several times. The %x% pattern is easy to spot and count. This makes it ideal for testing the MPI program. The goal is to count the occurrences of %x% in this text. It is important to note that the pattern %x% can appear in various contexts within a paragraph. Sometimes, the pattern %x% might be more subtle, while other times it is blatantly obvious. The MPI program should accurately count how many times the pattern %x% appears, regardless of its position in the text. This paragraph serves as a sample for testing the MPI program's ability to find and count the pattern %x% efficiently and accurately. In this paragraph, the pattern %x% appears multiple times in different sentences.
